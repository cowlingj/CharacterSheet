1) Remove Fields
   The remove field method should take the name of a field and remove a field
   with that name.
   
   foreach field in field list
    if field name == givenName
      remove field

2) Update Field (model)
   When the text in a field's JTextField is changed then the model should
   be updated.
   
3) Add field error
   If a field is given a name that matches another in the field list... break.
